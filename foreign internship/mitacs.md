👉What does Mitacs stand for?
The Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems
Why the name “Mitacs”? The answer is part of our proud history. In our early days, Mitacs was known as “The Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems, (MITACS NCE)”. The acronym referred to our original mandate to connect mathematics researchers to industry and professional development opportunities.
