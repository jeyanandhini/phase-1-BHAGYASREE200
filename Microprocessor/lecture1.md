**The things I grasseped from this lecture**        
â—¾ Microprocessor is also known as Î¼p .       
â—¾ We need processors in programs .    

   â–« examples of small programs use of microprocessor                                                         
   1.Traffic signals .                
   2.Railways information in their screens.   
   
   â–« examples of big use of microprocessor    
   1.intel core i7       
   2.intel core i5    
   etc      
 
**The introductions of microprocessor**                                
ðŸ‘‰ the first [microprocessor is 8085 .](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/microprocessor_8085_architecture.htm)                              
ðŸ‘‰ the second and most remarable[microprocessor is 8086.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/microprocessor_8086_overview.htm)         
                   some more in 86 family 
                   80186  
                   80286      
                   80386          
                   80486     
    80586  p1 is called pentian p1 from here **we became to use multimedia and many more things like video games**  etc .

 **The exact  location of microprocessor**                           
 computer contain many input and output devices and **cpu** the mother board  contains in middle we have fat chip inside we can see **_microprocessor_**

 **Now we discuss about _memory_**       
   1. primary memory             
   2. secondary memory                          
   
   but here we are discussing about primary memory                  
   1.RAM    
   2.ROM 
   
**RAM** stands for random access memory               
It is divided into three sub groups               
**_S RAM _**                    
**_D RAM_**                     
**_SD RAM_**              
S RAM stands for static random access memory,its is very fast ,and stored in flipflops(A flip-flop is a device which stores a single bit (binary digit) of data; one of its two states represents a "one" and the other represents a "zero".)                                    
D RAM stands for dynamic random access memory,its is less faster then static,and stored in capacitors (A capacitor is a component made of two or sets of two conductive plates with a thin insulator between them and wrapped in a ceramic and plastic container. )                                        
SD RAM stands for synchronous dynamic random access memory .

**every thing in microprocessor is stored as zeros and ones**                        


total clarity about how images and movies stored [pixels](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z2tgr82)               
1 bit has 2 shades 
2 bit has 4 shades 
3 bit has 8 shades              
4 bit has 16 shades      and so on .........................                                      

**_in the world all multimedias are running with 0's and 1's _**
