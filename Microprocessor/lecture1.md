**The things I grasseped from this lecture**        
â—¾ Microprocessor is also known as Î¼p .       
â—¾ We need processors in programs .    

   â–« examples of small programs use of microprocessor                                                         
   1.Traffic signals .                
   2.Railways information in their screens.   
   
   â–« examples of big use of microprocessor    
   1.intel core i7       
   2.intel core i5    
   etc      
 
**The introductions of microprocessor**                                
ðŸ‘‰ the first [microprocessor is 8085 .](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/microprocessor_8085_architecture.htm)                              
ðŸ‘‰ the second and most remarable[microprocessor is 8086.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/microprocessor/microprocessor_8086_overview.htm)         
                   some more in 86 family 
                   80186  
                   80286      
                   80386          
                   80486     
    80586  p1 is called pentian p1 from here **we became to use multimedia and many more things like video games**  etc .

 **The exact  location of microprocessor**                           
 computer contain many input and output devices and **cpu** the mother board  contains in middle we have fat chip inside we can see **-microprocessor-**

**now we discuss about memory **       
   1. primary memory             
   2. secondary memory                          
   
   but here we are discussing about primary memory                  
   1.RAM    
   2.ROM
