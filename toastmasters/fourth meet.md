As my role is evaluator 
       I discussed about Aman sahu's speech he used many good words as it was his first attempt ,he done a great job .                 
       As his voice is base voice all the listeners attracted to his speech .             
       He discussed about his past experiences which is very impacting o everyone .           
       And about his school experiences ,as he came across his worst days also .           
       
     â€¢He can improve in some issues .
       1. can use hand gestures .
       2. can give some gap between speech.
