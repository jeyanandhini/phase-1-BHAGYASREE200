**Types of C Constants**
C constants can be divided into two major categories:            
(a)Primary Constants              
(b)Secondary Constants                             

Primary Constants        Secondary Constants              
Integer Constant            Array                
Real Constant               Pointer                
Character Constant           Structure                     
                             Union               
                          
**Rules for Constructing Integer Constants**                 
(a) An integer constant must have at least one digit.            
(b)It must not have a decimal point.                         
(c)It can be either positive or negative.                      
(d)If no sign precedes an integer constant it is assumed to be
positive.                                           
(e)No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.                 
(f)The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to 32767.                  

**Rules for Constructing Real Constants**         
Real constants are often called Floating Point constants. The real
constants could be written in two formsâ€”Fractional form and
Exponential form.                           
Following rules must be observed while constructing real
constants expressed in fractional form:                        
(a)A real constant must have at least one digit.                                    
(b)It must have a decimal point.                               
(c)It could be either positive or negative.                
(d)Default sign is positive.              
(e) No commas or blanks are allowed within a real constant.
