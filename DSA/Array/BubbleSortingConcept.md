Bubble Sort ðŸŒ€

Bubble sort may be defined as the sorting algorithm that follows the approach of replacing the value
in the first index with the smallest value in the array and keep it repeating until the list is sorted.
It is a very simple way of performing sorting. In this way to sort the array, the value has to be assigned
to the array in the beginning before starting the sorting.
