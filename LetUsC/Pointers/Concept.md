â€¢  [**Pointers**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)  
 
 **ðŸ”‘The pointer in C language is a variable which stores the address of another variable. This variable can be of type int,                    
 char, array, function, or any other pointer. The size of the pointer depends on the architecture. However, in 32-bit                      
 architecture the size of a pointer is 2 byte.**                                                      
 
                 int n = 10;                         
                 int* p = &n                    
 â€¢**Declaring a pointer**                                    
**The pointer in c language can be declared using * (asterisk symbol). It is also known as indirection pointer used to               
 dereference a pointer.**                
 
                  int *a;//pointer to int                       
                  char *c;//pointer to char                         
                  
  
**Example**

**As you can see in the above figure, pointer variable stores the address of number variable, i.e., fff4. The value of                     
number variable is 50. But the address of pointer variable p is aaa3.**
**By the help of** * **(indirection operator), we can print the value of pointer variable p.**
