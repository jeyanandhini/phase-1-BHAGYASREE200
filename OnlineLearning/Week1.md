1Ô∏è‚É£ **Two modes of thinking they are focused and diffuse.**                             

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The focused mode has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers, which seems to, in some sense            
   help keep your thoughts concentrated.                    
   The diffuse mode on the other hand has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad            
   ranging ways of thinking.**        
   
3Ô∏è‚É£**Next tackling is procrastination is so very important. The easiest way to tackle procrastination              
   is to use the Pomodoro technique. That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed                 
   by a bit of mental relaxation.**                    
   
4Ô∏è‚É£**Memory of course is an important aspect of learning. There are four slots in our working memory.                 
   Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind. In that                    
   sense working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is             
   like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into            
   long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit              
   of repetition to freshen the memory up.**
