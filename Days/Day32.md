### 2D arrays................

**Two – dimensional array is the simplest form of a multidimensional array. We can see a two – dimensional                             
  array as an array of one – dimensional array for easier understanding.**                            
**The basic form of declaring a two-dimensional array of size x, y: 
Syntax:**                            
                             data_type array_name[x][y];                           
                             data_type: Type of data to be stored. Valid C/C++ data type.                 
                             
**We can declare a two-dimensional integer array say ‘x’ of size 10,20 as:**                
                 int x[10][20];

• **Elements in two-dimensional arrays are commonly referred to by x[i][j] where i is the row number and ‘j’ is the column number.           
A two – dimensional array can be seen as a table with ‘x’ rows and ‘y’ columns where the row number ranges                  
from 0 to (x-1) and column number ranges from 0 to (y-1). A two – dimensional array ‘x’ with 3 rows and 3 columns is shown below:**
