**What Does Subarray Mean?                                                                       
A subarray is commonly defined as a part or section of an array. An array is a set of variables that a programmer         
defines collectively. Instead of creating separate variables, the programmer can declare a single array with multiple values labeled.                                          
Programmers can perform many of the same options on a subarray that they can perform on the entire array. Allowing operations on a                  
subarray helps make these tools more versatile for storing multiple variables in a single designated set.**
