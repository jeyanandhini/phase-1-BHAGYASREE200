**What Does Subarray Mean?                                                                       
A subarray is commonly defined as a part or section of an array. An array is a set of variables that a programmer         
defines collectively. Instead of creating separate variables, the programmer can declare a single array with multiple values labeled.                                          
Programmers can perform many of the same options on a subarray that they can perform on the entire array. Allowing operations on a                  
subarray helps make these tools more versatile for storing multiple variables in a single designated set.**

**A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on                            
the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.**                                          
 
•[**Window Sliding**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/)                          

**What Does Sliding Window Mean?
Sliding window is a technique for controlling transmitted data packets between two network computers where reliable            
and sequential delivery of data packets is required, such as when using the Data Link Layer (OSI model) or Transmission                    
Control Protocol (TCP).                                          
In the sliding window technique, each data packet (for most data link layers) and byte (in TCP) includes a unique consecutive                   
sequence number, which is used by the receiving computer to place data in the correct order. The objective of the sliding window                      
technique is to use the sequence numbers to avoid duplicate data and to request missing data.**
