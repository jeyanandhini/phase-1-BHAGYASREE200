### Steped into Trees ...................

â€¢ [**Max Heap**](https://algorithmtutor.com/Data-Structures/Tree/Binary-Heaps/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20types%20of,equal%20to%20its%20children%20nodes.)              
  **There are two types of heaps depending upon how the nodes are ordered in the tree. max-heap: In max-heap,                    
  a parent node is always larger than or equal to its children nodes. min-heap: In min-heap, a parent node is                             
  always smaller than or equal to its children nodes.**
