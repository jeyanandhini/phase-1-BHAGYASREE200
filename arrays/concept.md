ðŸ”·DEFINATION OF ARRAY   
An array in C/C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored atcontiguous memory locations       
and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. They can be used to store collection of primitive data types such    
as int, float, double, char, etc of any particular type.To add to it, an array in C/C++ can store derived data types such as the    
structures, pointers etc. Given below is the picture representation of an array.

ðŸ”·Why do we need arrays?    
We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to store a large number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.
