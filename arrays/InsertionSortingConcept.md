**Insertion Sort**  üî≤              

1Ô∏è‚É£Insertion sort may be defined as the sorting algorithm that works by moving the minimum value at the                                                      
beginning of the list one at a time. This is a very less efficient sorting algorithm and not found                           
suitable to deal with the large list.

2Ô∏è‚É£This approach of sorting the algorithm works very slowly and usually not preferred in any of the applications.                          
It can work good with the list that has pretty few numbers of elements. For the applications, that have the requirement                      
to process a few numbers of values can leverage this algorithm
